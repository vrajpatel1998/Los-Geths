I was so hungry and didn’t want to wait for a new order. So, I removed the guac and lettuce.\n\nThis is the second time the guac has been rotten or old. Many times (not this time) my order is wrong or missing something.\n\nI want to give 5 stars because it’s available and staff seem nice, just not on top of it with the quality of the product.

Thanks guys\n\nOk so I ordered the subs this time...philly cheesesteak and New York steak sub\n\nPhilly was amazing, the New York steak was ok since I think they used the same meat that is in philly and not an actual ny steak but overal fresh, fast and yummy!!! Delivery guy was professional and sweet\nKeep up the good work! Will be ordering again and again as long as you guys are keeping it up :)\n\nOrdered hot wings-they are to die for!","time":1600167707},{"author_name":"Tiara Croft","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118297648793923242869/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7MmU0jzBFhE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuucnjTOzUtzxh8A68KHCwk_F-1bAabQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg","language":"en","rating":5,"text":"This is one of my favorite go-to Italian restaurants. The staff are always so friendly, the ambience is so lively, and the food is amazing. I always say that I will try something new but inevitably end up getting the gnocchi and beef carpacio.\n\nI love that it's a small, upscale space that is good for dates, lunches, and families. They really cater to whatever you're looking for.\n\nI haven't used it, but I believe there's also a small room that can be rented out for private gatherings, which helps take you away from the noise and bustle of the restaurant if you want something more intimate.\n\nHave been countless times, will always return when I'm in LA.","time":1598927681},{"author_name":"Staven Moraon","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107746205911593994052/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgP5xvCOcSS-naWI-zWKLF1Qfc39QdMFcmSe4sW=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","language":"en","rating":4,"text":"Ugh I just love this place.

this Coco’s location is literally the reason I came to Cali for the first time. We’ve eaten twice here in the past 3 days. If you’ve been to Tokyo, the LA USA locations are just as good as in Tokyo. Just wish they had garlic bits. Also recommend the Chicken Cutlets, they’re the best to try first. Highly highly recommend this restaurant for an amazing taste of Japan!","time":1599356419},{"author_name":"Herbert Patterson","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114323654535140306884/reviews","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gNKGUVHwOFk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMZuuckGq7S-klRN7eSpk60mChg09CdOWQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","language":"en","rating":5,"text":"This place is delicious.
